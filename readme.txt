Set up an awesome support ticket system on any WordPress site.

== Description ==

Support Dock upgrades your site from good to INCREDIBLE by adding a **support ticket** system.

The Support Dock plugin uses a simple yet powerful traditional support 'submit a ticket' system. The 'submit a ticket' system appears as part of the site template and dashboard. Let users contact you directly, and receive responses by email. No need for user's to access your site dashboard. All responses are emailed to the user's real mailbox. You recieve email notification each time a new ticket is submitted. You can answer All Tickets from your admin dashboard. This style of professional integration helps you achieve maximum convenience and site security.
